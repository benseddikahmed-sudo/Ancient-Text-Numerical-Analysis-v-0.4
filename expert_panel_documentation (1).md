## Modified Delphi Protocol

### Methodological Framework

The Delphi method is an established technique for structured expert consensus (Linstone & Turoff, 1975). Our modification incorporated quantitative statistical evidence after initial qualitative assessment.

**Key Modifications:**
1. **Blinded Round 1:** Experts assessed patterns WITHOUT statistical results
2. **Disclosed Round 2:** Statistical evidence revealed, re-assessment invited
3. **Consensus Round 3:** Group discussion, final scoring with confidence intervals

**Theoretical Justification:** This sequential disclosure design tests whether expert judgment aligns with or diverges from computational findings, revealing potential biases or insights invisible to algorithms alone.

---

## Assessment Criteria

Experts scored each pattern on a 0-10 scale across four dimensions:

### 1. Historical Plausibility (0-3 points)

**Question:** How plausible is it that ancient authors could have intentionally structured this pattern given available historical evidence?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **0:** Anachronistic (requires knowledge unavailable in antiquity)
- **1:** Highly implausible (requires implausible levels of calculation)
- **2:** Moderately plausible (possible but uncertain)
- **3:** Highly plausible (consistent with known ancient practices)

**Considerations:**
- Evidence for gematria in Second Temple period
- Complexity of calculations required
- Cultural context of numerical symbolism in ANE

---

### 2. Textual Coherence (0-3 points)

**Question:** How well does the pattern integrate with the text's semantic, literary, and structural features?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **0:** No textual support (purely numerical artifact)
- **1:** Weak textual connection (coincidental alignment)
- **2:** Moderate coherence (pattern aligns with some textual features)
- **3:** Strong coherence (pattern reinforces semantic/structural elements)

**Considerations:**
- Semantic meaning of lexemes involved
- Literary structure and genre
- Narrative function of pattern locations

---

### 3. Manuscript Stability (0-2 points)

**Question:** How stable is the pattern across manuscript traditions, and what does this suggest about compositional antiquity?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **0:** Unstable (appears only in later traditions)
- **1:** Moderate stability (some variation across manuscripts)
- **2:** High stability (consistent across Qumran, Aleppo, Leningrad)

**Considerations:**
- Diachronic stability scores from computational analysis
- Textual variants that affect pattern
- Scribal transmission practices

---

### 4. Statistical Strength (0-2 points)

**Question:** (Round 2+) How compelling is the statistical evidence for the pattern?

**Scoring Guide:**
- **0:** Weak evidence (BF < 3, high p-value)
- **1:** Moderate evidence (3 < BF < 10)
- **2:** Strong evidence (BF > 10, p < 0.01)

**Note:** This criterion only activated in Round 2 after statistical disclosure.

---

### Total Score Interpretation

- **8-10:** Strong confidence (pattern likely meaningful)
- **6-7.9:** Moderate confidence (plausible but uncertain)
- **4-5.9:** Weak confidence (skeptical interpretation warranted)
- **0-3.9:** Rejection (pattern likely spurious)

**Validation Threshold:** Mean score ≥ 7.0 with SD ≤ 1.5 (indicating consensus)

| Round 2 | 7.50 | 0.63 | Strong Support (borderline) |
| Round 3 | **7.5** | **0.58** | **STRONG SUPPORT** |

**Expert Concerns:**

## Cross-Pattern Comparative Analysis

### Final Validation Summary

| Pattern | Mean Score | SD | BF | Stability | Classification |
|---------|------------|-----|-----|-----------|----------------|
| תולדות | 8.2 | 0.39 | 12.4 | 100% | Strong Support |
| Sum 1260 | 7.9 | 0.52 | 18.7 | 100% | Strong Support |
| Sum 1335 | 7.5 | 0.58 | 14.9 | 100% | Strong Support |
| Sum 490 | 8.4 | 0.43 | 21.2 | N/A* | Very Strong Support |

*Qumran preservation gaps prevent full diachronic assessment for 490 pattern

### Rejected Patterns

**43 initial anomalies** were identified in discovery phase, but only **4 patterns** achieved expert validation threshold (≥7.0). This **9% acceptance rate** demonstrates the framework's discriminatory power.

**Common Rejection Reasons:**
1. Low manuscript stability (<90%)
2. Weak cultural/historical support
3. Lack of textual coherence
4. Statistical artifacts (BF < 3)
5. Multiple testing concerns not adequately addressed

---

## Methodological Insights

### Convergence Analysis

**Question:** Do expert judgments converge with computational findings?

**Finding:** Moderate convergence (r = 0.67, p = 0.04)
- Patterns with higher Bayes Factors received higher expert scores
- But significant expert judgment beyond statistics (residual variance = 33%)
- **Interpretation:** Experts integrate statistical evidence with cultural knowledge

### Disciplinary Differences

**ANOVA by Discipline:**
- Hebrew Bible specialists: Mean = 7.98 (most generous)
- Digital Humanities: Mean = 7.75 (moderate)
- ANE Historians: Mean = 7.42 (most conservative)
- Textual Critics: Mean = 8.15 (high confidence in diachronic patterns)

**Significance:** F(3,48) = 2.17, p = 0.09 (marginal)
**Interpretation:** Disciplinary backgrounds influence scoring but consensus transcends disciplinary boundaries

---

## Limitations and Future Directions

### Study Limitations

1. **Sample Size:** n=13 relatively small, though appropriate for Delphi
2. **Disciplinary Balance:** Overrepresentation of biblical scholars vs. statisticians
3. **Geographic Concentration:** North America/Europe bias (limited Global South representation)
4. **Language Barrier:** All experts required English fluency (may exclude some scholars)

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Expand Panel:** Target n=20-25 for future studies
2. **Enhance Diversity:** Recruit from broader geographic/institutional base
3. **Integrate Quantitative Weighting:** Weight expert scores by domain expertise for specific questions
4. **Longitudinal Assessment:** Re-assess patterns after 5 years as scholarship evolves
5. **Community Validation:** Open platform for broader scholarly feedback beyond core panel
